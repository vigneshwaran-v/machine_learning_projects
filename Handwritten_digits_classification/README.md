# Handwritten digits recognition

Datasets used : MNIST and USPS handwritten digits.

In this project handwritten digits of MNIST and USPS are classified with three different models.

Models implemented: Logistic regression, Multilayer Perceptron with one hidden layer and COnvolutional Neural network.
